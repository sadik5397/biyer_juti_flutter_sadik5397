## WHY BIYERJUTI?
We bring you completely unique matchmaking experience so far in Bangladesh. We have taken the norms of our culture to build this website. Each user is verified by official ID documents. We heavily encourage the involvement of guardians throughout. Our well-equipped search engine will find you the one you are looking for. We have also empowered our users to control its visitors. The process of this website runs on mutual consent. Each and every step is well informed. There is no hide and seek. Transparency and ingenuity are the integral parts of our system.

## VERIFIED ACCOUNTS ONLY
We verify each account using NID or Passport. Only verified accounts can use our services. This keeps our site genuine and away from fraudsters. We aim to gain your full confidence and provide you a pleasant experience.

## SEARCH ENGINE JUST FOR YOU
We have enriched our search engine with different filters to assist you to find the right partner. In Biyer Juti, you can search by Profession, age, location, education, religion and many others. For example, if you are a doctor and looking for a life partner in the same profession, you may easily select “Doctor” under the Profession in Search menu and hit the Search Button. All the doctors in Biyerjuti will be listed for you.

## CONTROL WHO VIEWS YOUR PROFILE
In matrimonial matters, people generally hesitate to have their profiles online as they find it awkward to portray their profiles to public in general. First of all, profiles created in Biyer Juti can be viewed by other verified users only. Secondly, you have a better control over your privacy as you can determine which type of users can view your profile. For example, a female lawyer is looking for a potential life partner in the same profession. If she does not want viewers from any other profession, then she may easily select “Lawyer” from the profession filter at the bottom of her profile and then only the Lawyers will be able to view her profile. As a result she will be protected from any unwanted visitors.

## BE UNDER GUARDIAN SUPERVISION
One of the main highlights of Biyer Juti is how we have preserved our culture by encouraging our users to involve guardians to play an essential role in the choosing their life partners. However, if you do not have a guardian or any adult supervision, you can still be a part of Biyer Juti by simply checking a box and declaring the truth of it. To maintain transparency and encourage involvement of guardians, the users of Biyer Juti will be allowed to see whether you have a supervising guardian or you are on your own.

## LIMITED HEARTS INCREASES THE VALUE OF IT
You can only give 5 hearts each day to others. This restriction increases the value of each heart given. That is whoever will receive your heart will understand the preciousness and hence would value the same. We encourage you to choose only the most suitable, without being carried away with the flow! This saves your time, and also focuses your mind on picking the profile most likely to be a success.

## HOW MUCH IS THE COST?
➡️ Registration is free! ➡️ View all profiles for free! ➡️ Return hearts for free! ➡️ For the contact number of your match, pay Tk. 700/- (If the other party fails to pay then the paying party gets full refund.) ➡️ To give hearts, upgrade to premium version for Tk. 1,000/- After the exchange of hearts, the parties will find each other at the Match menu. Now, if the parties are quite serious about taking the matter further, then they may choose to reveal the contact number at a cost of Tk. 700/- each. We would only reveal the contact numbers to each party after receipt of payment from both. We believe the payment process ensures us the ultimate consent of the parties to take the matter further and revelation of the contact numbers after payment from both side increases success rates as well. If your match fails to make payment on time then you will receive full refund.

## NO INTERFERENCE
At the final stage, once payment is complete by you and your matched profile, we reveal the contact numbers to each party. Once we have done so, we are out of the picture and you can contact your match and proceed ahead without any interference from our side. We do not take any success fees, but we do welcome your beautiful story!

## USER-FRIENDLY WEBSITE
We have kept the design of Biyerjuti very simple. Simplicity in the design makes this website easy to operate and therefore user friendly. You’ll find videos and notes in the site to make your journey smooth as silk. Happy browsing!

## HOW BIYERJUTI WORKS?
Search. Give a heart. Get a heart back. Voila! You have a match. Request contact number of your match. If your request is accepted then Make Payment. When both parties pay, we call and reveal the contact numbers. Let’s take an example- You gave hearts to Anika, Manika & Tanika. But you got a heart only from Manika. So, You have a match with Manika. Now, you can request for Manika’s phone number. If Manika accepts your request, then both of you will have to pay Tk. 700/- each. After successful payments, we will call and reveal the contact numbers. It’s that easy!
